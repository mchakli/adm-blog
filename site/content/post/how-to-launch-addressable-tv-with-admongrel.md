First, you need to decide on the aim of the campaign and whether it is best served by campaign creatives that are static or interactive. Both work well.

We offer 3 template banner formats: L-banner, Bottom banner and Top banner. Our experience shows that L-Banner works better for increased attention among viewers and  up to 35% of the screen can be used. Bottom and top banners cover less area and work well when there is a clear call-to-action. This is where a good creative, typically offering an incentive to engage, works well. A clear call-to-action designed for the big screen will generate significant increases in the engagement rates.

Interactive applications enable you to have a two-way communication with your target audience, a different and interesting experience for your viewer. If you want to provide a unique engagement experience for your audience, we can also develop a tailor-made application for your brand.

Broadcast TV advertising is useful to reach your audience on a mass scale.  Addressable TV advertising is useful to reach your audience on a mass scale and delivering tailored messages based on geographic targeting. You can show different creatives to different geographic locations and set different display rules for your audience.
