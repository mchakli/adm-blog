Maximize Addressable TV CTRs with These Designs

Addressable TV enables you to show more engaging TV ads. At Admongrel, we are pioneering  this new technology and offer addressable TV interactive ads in a variety of designs. Banner types can be chosen out of two commonly used types:  L-banner and bottom banner.

![L-Banner](/img/7f1dd792-2b28-4db9-9863-25ad278a4649.png "L-Banner")

L- banner is the most commonly used banner type for the interactive ads.  When an advert is shown, it proportionally shrinks the  the viewing area on the TV screen showing ads at the top and along one edge.

![Bottom Banner](/img/e8e9aee7-1eb6-45a4-bb80-b3f98de44021.png "Bottom Banner")

Another banner type is the bottom banner. It is similar to the traditional TV advertising banners, it is less obtrusive, the CTRs achieved with this layout are slightly lower than the L-banner.

The Landing Page is typically a full-screen image that opens when audiences interact with the media. You can continue to watch the TV show in a smaller size. On the landing page, you can offer further information and details about the brand and campaign. In addition, if you want to provide deeper engagement with your audiences, Admongrel can develop a tailor-made application for your brand. Audiences can leave their mobile numbers, and participate in live quizzes or simple games for example.

At Admongrel, while we are designing the campaign, we put emphasis on legibility and expressiveness. Following 3 simple rules will ensure your campaigns achieve higher CTRs:

* Images and texts should be bigger
* In contrast to web design, your customers interact with the ads using the TV remote control, so you need to have clear instructions showing your audiences how to interact
* The TV screen is limited to certain areas for design, so it is important to use them effectively

Due to our experiences, we are able to increase aesthetics and legibility by optimizing your campaign UX/UI. Some examples from succesful campaigns are below.
